<h1>Portifolium</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>My portifolium with a design based on <b>Visual Studio Code</b>.</p>
<p>It was created as a way to show my skills as a web developer (in this case, frontend) with a design full based on the VSCode made from scratch with animations and javascript functionalities.</p>
<p>The idea came when I was using Visual Studio Code for other projects, while looking for ways to showcase what I've done till now but did not want a simple website or page with no personality or singular characteristics.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>The tool can be viewed in <b>Portugues</b> and <b>English</b> and you can change the language in the Languages Menu, on the left sidebar menu.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Boostrap</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>Jquery</li>
</ul>
